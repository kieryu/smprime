					<p>BDO Foundation brings the bank’s out-of-the-box principle of “We Find Ways” to a whole new level as it breaks ground with its ingenious approach to financial inclusion. In partnership with the Department of Education (DepEd) and the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP),  BDO launched the financial education program for public schools, in support of DepEd’s efforts to strengthen the financial literacy component of its K to 12 curriculum and enhance its capability to train teachers and non-teaching personnel on personal financial management. The initiative is also aligned with BSP’s National Strategy for Financial Inclusion.</p>
